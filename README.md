This is a visulization of the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm for finding the maximum flow and minimum cut in a network.

For more information on the algorithm: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm

Using the great graph visulization resource from here: https://gist.github.com/rkirsling/5001347

The running algorithm can be found here: http://ford-fulkerson.herokuapp.com

Instructions for use:

- Click in the open space to add a node, drag from one node to another to add an edge
- Ctrl-drag a node to move the graph layout
- Click a node or an edge to select it
- When a node is selected: Delete removes the node
- When an edge is selected: Delete removes the edge
- Each arc is automatically assigned a random number between 1 and 99 as a maximum flow value
- To assign an arc a new max flow value, select it, type the flow (1-99), then press enter
